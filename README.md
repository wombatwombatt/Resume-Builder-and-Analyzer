Original Project Description
The Resume Builder and Analyzer (RBA) is a dynamic application that enables users to create, customize, and evaluate professional resumes based on industry standards and role-specific benchmarks. It leverages object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity, extensibility, and maintainability. The system supports both novice and experienced users by offering intelligent suggestions, formatting tools, and analytics that assess resume quality, keyword relevance, and alignment with job descriptions

•	Generates resumes based on user input and evaluates them against job descriptions.

•	Resume sections modeled as objects; analysis strategies as interchangeable modules.
